# seventyfive_zen (75z)

**Interactive knowledge iteration engine.**

Do → See → Understand → Change → Repeat

## Quick Start

```bash
75z
```

Then just press numbers!

## Interactive Commands

**`1`** - Complete BUILD (60-90m)
**`2`** - Complete BODY (20-30m)  
**`3`** - Complete SYSTEM (10-15m)
**`4`** - Add INSIGHT (5-10m)

**`t`** - Start timer for a loop
**`i`** - Info about what each loop means
**`v`** - View today's details
**`p`** - View past 7 days
**`s`** - Set intention (if not set)
**`q`** - Quit

## The Loops

### BUILD (60-90m)
Deep work on your main project (CM3070/HotelOPS)
- What are you building?
- What's the hardest part?
- What will you ship today?

### BODY (20-30m)
Physical training - push/dips/KB/walk
- What exercise?
- How many reps/duration?
- How do you feel?

### SYSTEM (10-15m)
Simplify one thing - file/config/process
- What needs simplifying?
- What can you delete?
- How to make it cleaner?

### INSIGHT (5-10m)
Extract today's learning
- What did you learn?
- What tiny change for tomorrow?
- What belief updated?

## Features

- **Visual progress bar** - see completion at a glance
- **Timers** - track how long each loop takes
- **Edge tracking** - difficulty levels 1-10
- **Surprise capture** - what was unexpected?
- **Insight forwarding** - yesterday's learning → today's action
- **No manual editing** - everything through the interface

## Workflow

1. Run `75z`
2. Press `s` to set intention (first time)
3. Press `t` → `1` to start BUILD timer
4. Do deep work for 60-90m
5. Press `1` to complete BUILD (timer stops automatically)
6. Answer the prompts (edge, surprise, understanding)
7. Repeat for BODY (`2`) and SYSTEM (`3`)
8. Press `4` at end of day for insight
9. Tomorrow: yesterday's insight appears automatically

## Data Storage

- `~/75z_logs/YYYY-MM-DD.json` - Machine data
- `~/75z_logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md` - Human readable

## Philosophy

Every interaction reinforces:
- "I am someone who learns every day"
- "I am someone who iterates"
- "I am someone who sharpens craft"

Not: "I checked a box"
