# 75z

**Ultraminimal daily tracker. No gates. No enforcement. Just clarity.**

---

## The Principle

Assumed outcome  
→ Attention bias  
→ Language consistency  
→ Repeated action  
→ Compounded probability  
→ Result

**You don't get what you want.**  
**You get what you no longer internally debate.**

- Nothing "manifests" for the indecisive.
- The universe doesn't reward desire.
- It responds to clarity + coherence + time.

**Process:**
1. Name the outcome precisely
2. Assume it as inevitable
3. Eliminate internal counter-speech
4. Act without emotional urgency
5. Outlast your own doubt

Decide. Remove doubt. Act consistently. Detach from timing. Persist.
