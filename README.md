# 75z — Alignment Journaling OS

**You are not journaling to remember. You are journaling to become inevitable.**

---

## The Principle

Assumed outcome  
→ Attention bias  
→ Language consistency  
→ Repeated action  
→ Compounded probability  
→ Result

**You don't get what you want.**  
**You get what you no longer internally debate.**

1. Name the outcome precisely
2. Assume it as inevitable
3. Eliminate internal counter-speech
4. Act without emotional urgency
5. Outlast your own doubt

Decide. Remove doubt. Act consistently. Detach from timing. Persist.

## Installation

```bash
# Add alias to your shell
echo 'alias 75z="python3 ~/path/to/seventyfive_zen.py"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

---

## Usage

### Morning: Read ALIGNMENT.md

```bash
75z
> a
```

This is your state setter. Read it once. Don't edit daily.

You're not "motivating" — you're declaring identity.

### Evening: Reconcile (the core)

```bash
75z
> 4
```

You'll be prompted:

```
RESULT (1 sentence, concrete):
→

WHERE ATTENTION HELD (1 sentence):
→

WHERE IT DRIFTED (optional):
→

TOMORROW LOCK (1 unavoidable action):
→
```

**Rules:**
- No emotions
- No stories
- No explanations
- If vague → rewrite

This is how inside and outside are forced to match.

### View Mirror

```bash
75z
> v
```

Shows:
- Today's result
- Where attention held
- Tomorrow lock

No stats. No streaks. Mirrors reinforce identity faster than metrics.

### Past Patterns

```bash
75z
> p
```

Past 7 days. Read-only.

You're not looking for productivity.  
You're looking for drift patterns: where attention leaks, what keeps repeating.

Your nervous system learns by exposure.

### Reset

```bash
75z
> r
```

Delete today's log. Re-read ALIGNMENT.md. Start clean.

Reset = state correction, not failure.

---

## Commands

```
a - Read ALIGNMENT.md (morning)
4 - Reconcile (evening)
v - View today (mirror)
p - Past 7 days (patterns)
r - Reset today
i - Info
q - Quit
```

## Data Model

```json
{
  "date": "2025-12-12",
  "result": "Wrote and finalized prototype section",
  "attention": "On removing ambiguity and tightening scope",
  "drift": "Checked messages twice",
  "tomorrow": "Review reconciliation API edge cases"
}
```

That's enough to bend reality over time.

## Files Generated

```
~/75z_logs/YYYY-MM-DD.json  # Raw data
~/75z_logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md    # Human mirror
```

### Example Log

```markdown
# 2025-12-12

**RESULT:** Wrote and finalized prototype section

**ATTENTION HELD:** On removing ambiguity and tightening scope
**DRIFT:** Checked messages twice

**TOMORROW LOCK:** Review reconciliation API edge cases
```

---

## What This OS Quietly Enforces

- You ask as if it's already done → because you write from result
- You eliminate doubt → because tomorrow is locked
- You shape attention → because drift is named, not indulged
- You become consistent → because identity never changes daily

This is why it feels like a prayer, but functions like a compiler.

---

## Philosophy

State → Attention → Action → Result

You never explain this. You write from it.

No gates. No enforcement. No complexity.

Just: Inside = Outside

---

**That's it.**
