# Daily Alignment

Write or speak this daily. No frameworks. No references. Just alignment.

## Morning

I choose clarity.

What I am moving toward is already mine,
so I act without hesitation or doubt.

My mind is quiet.
My attention rests on what matters.
My words are clean and deliberate.
My actions follow naturally.

I do not chase outcomes.
I embody them.

What is inside me and what I do outside are the same thing.
There is no split, no argument, no resistance.

I take the next obvious step
and I take it fully.

Timing is not my concern.
Consistency is.

I am calm.
I am exact.
I do what I set out to do.

---

## Closing (pick one)

- "I move as one piece."
- "Nothing pulls me off course."
- "This is already done; I am executing."

---

## Ultra-Minimal (4 lines)

I choose clarity.
What is inside and what I do are the same.
I take the next step fully.
I am calm, exact, consistent.

## Evening Variation

Today I moved as one piece.
My attention stayed where I placed it.
Tomorrow's step is already clear.
I rest in alignment.

## Usage

**Morning:** Read the full version. Set state.
**Evening:** Read the closing. Note what shifted.
**Anytime:** Return to "I choose clarity."

No tracking. No enforcement. Just return to center.
